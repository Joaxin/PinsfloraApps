Reading is a fulfilling, mind-enhancing journey. 

In reading, many positive values, world views, and philosophy of life would be carved.
 If we want to progress and see a bit farther than some others, we'd better stand on the shoulders of giants, which inspire us to read more masterpieces of predecessors, and reading them is equivalent to communicating with men of great minds.
